# **Exploring my genetic code from 23 & me**

A repo comparing my 23 and me raw data to SNPedia database using python in Jupyter Notebook

## Why look at raw data? 
#### Doesn't 23 & me tell me the same thing?

23 and me tells me a lot, but it doesn't tell me everything. My goal was to explore my raw data myself to see what else I could find.
In addition, I wanted to find research articles that discussed my genes.

## Methods & Results

To explore my data, I cleaned it up and matched my genes to the database on [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com)-
